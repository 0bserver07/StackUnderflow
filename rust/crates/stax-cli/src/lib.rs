//! Charter (`docs/specs/rust-port.md` §3): port `cli.py` — the same command
//! names, the same flags, the same output shapes, so a script written against
//! the Python CLI keeps working when `stax` replaces it. Wave 8 owns the long
//! tail and the `--help`-tree diff; wave 0 ships exactly one command, `store` (né `status` — DIV-025 ruling),
//! whose entire job is to be checkable against Python on the real store.
