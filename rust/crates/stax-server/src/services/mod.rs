//! The service layer — `stackunderflow/services/*.py` and `reports/*.py`.
//!
//! # Why this directory exists
//!
//! Wave 5's first two endpoint batches ported the routes that *are* their
//! handlers: `routes/cost.py` and `routes/projects.py` carry their own SQL and
//! their own arithmetic, so `routes/cost.rs` carries it too and the file map is
//! one-to-one. The seven modules batch C inherited are the opposite shape —
//! each is a thin HTTP wrapper (55–405 lines) over a large unported service
//! (262–871 lines) that the CLI calls through the *same* function. `/api/compare`
//! and `stackunderflow compare` share `services/compare.py`; `/api/export` and
//! `stackunderflow export` share `reports/export.py::run_export`.
//!
//! Transliterating that logic into the route module would fork it: wave 8 ports
//! the CLI verbs, finds no shared home, and writes a second copy that drifts.
//! So the split Python already has is the split reproduced here — the route
//! module parses query parameters, validates them, calls one function in this
//! directory, and stamps currency. Everything else lives here.
//!
//! # Ownership
//!
//! Batch C owns this directory and the single `mod services;` line in
//! [`crate`]'s root. Nothing else in `lib.rs` was touched, and `routes/mod.rs`
//! was not touched at all — the 34 slots were already wired by the wave-5 lead.
//!

// ── wave 8 tranche 3: the report layer moved out, and the paths did not ───────
//
// Twenty-two of the modules above are now `stax-reports`'s. The reason is in
// that crate's `lib.rs`: this directory was the shared home for logic `/api/…`
// and `stackunderflow …` both call, and it was the RIGHT split at the wrong
// address — living inside the HTTP crate meant `stax-cli` had to link `axum`
// and `tokio` to print a spend line (tranche 1 filed exactly that deviation).
//
// They are re-exported here, one name per line, rather than being reached for
// as `stax_reports::…` at each call site. That is deliberate and it is the
// whole reason the move was cheap: `crate::services::optimize::round_half_even`,
// `super::scope::Scope`, `crate::services::mart_queries::table_exists` — every
// path already written in `routes/` and in the eleven modules that stayed
// resolves to the same item it did before, so the split touched **no route
// module** and no handler. A `pub use` list is also honest about the ownership:
// these are consumed here, not owned here.
