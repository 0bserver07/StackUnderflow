//! The compiled-in `stackunderflow/static/` tree.
//!
//! `build.rs` generates a sorted `&[(&str, &[u8])]` — one `include_bytes!` per
//! file, keyed by the path relative to `stackunderflow/static/` with `/`
//! separators. This module is the read side: a binary search, a directory
//! predicate, and the path-to-key translation the route modules need.
//!
//! # Why the binary carries the bundle at all
//!
//! `docs/specs/decommission-report.md` §4.3 lists the React build as one of the
//! two RUNTIME couplings that kept a Rust-only machine dependent on the Python
//! package directory. Compiling it in is what makes `stax-server` stand with
//! `stackunderflow/` deleted. `STAX_STATIC_DIR` re-points at a directory for
//! frontend development, and that override is the only way to reach the disk.
//!
//! # The key space is the *nominal* path, not a real one
//!
//! Callers already do their path math against `AppState::static_dir()` —
//! `misc.rs`'s `/assets/{path}` containment check is a string-prefix test on a
//! lexically resolved path, ported from `os.path` and load-bearing (a request
//! resolving exactly to the assets directory is `400 Invalid path`, not `404`).
//! None of that math touches the disk, so it works unchanged against a root
//! that does not exist. [`key_for`] is the last step: it turns the resolved
//! absolute path back into a table key. The containment rules stay where they
//! were written, and only the final byte fetch moves.
